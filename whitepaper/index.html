  <h1>Slowlyy: A 30-Day Delay Crypto Wallet</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Slowlyy is a novel crypto wallet designed to mitigate the risks of wallet-draining attacks by introducing a mandatory 30-day transaction delay. By combining a dual-source date verification system with client-side enforcement and cryptographic validation, Slowlyy provides users a critical time window to detect unauthorized access before any crypto leaves their wallet.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
      Traditional crypto wallets execute transactions instantly. If a malicious actor gains access to the private key or device, they can immediately drain all assets. The speed of blockchain settlement becomes a security liability in such cases, as there's no way to intercept or reverse unauthorized transactions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Solution: 30-Day Time Lock</h2>
    <p>
      Slowlyy introduces a fixed 30-day delay on all transactions. This time buffer gives users the opportunity to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Detect unauthorized activity</li>
      <li>Revoke access</li>
      <li>Move funds to secure locations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All transaction requests are stored but delayed, only executable after 30 full days have passed.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Security Architecture</h2>
    <h3>Dual Time Verification</h3>
    <p>To prevent clock tampering or spoofed timestamps, Slowlyy uses a dual-source date confirmation system:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>WorldTimeAPI</strong>: Public, independent API providing UTC time. Used to prevent local clock spoofing.</li>
      <li><strong>Custom /date API with HMAC Signature</strong>:<br/>
        Self-hosted endpoint (e.g., <code>https://api.slowlyy.xyz/date</code>) returns JSON:
        <pre><code>{
  "date": "2025-08-01",
  "signature": "..." // HMAC-SHA256 of date
}</code></pre>
        Signature validated by app using shared secret. Ensures authenticity and integrity of the date.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Both APIs must agree on the date for any transaction check to pass.</p>

    <h3>Local Time Ignored</h3>
    <p>Slowlyy does not trust the deviceâ€™s internal clock. All date validations happen against the above external sources. This removes the risk of attackers spoofing local time to prematurely release funds.</p>

    <h3>Tamper-Resistant Logic</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Transactions are stored locally and/or off-chain until 30 days pass.</li>
      <li>Unlock logic is hard-coded to reject any date mismatch or invalid signature.</li>
      <li>If both APIs are unreachable, app defaults to blocking the transaction.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Developer Integration Flow</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>On transaction initiation, the app stores the <code>timestamp</code> and <code>unlock_date = timestamp + 30 days</code>.</li>
      <li>On app open or send attempt:
        <ul>
          <li>Request UTC date from WorldTimeAPI</li>
          <li>Request <code>/date</code> from Slowlyy API</li>
          <li>Compare both dates</li>
          <li>Verify HMAC signature</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If both sources match, signature is valid, and <code>current date >= unlock_date</code>, then transaction can be broadcast to the blockchain.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Security Assumptions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The shared HMAC key is known only to the app and server.</li>
      <li>HTTPS is used to prevent MITM attacks.</li>
      <li>Neither date source can independently spoof the time without detection.</li>
      <li>User has visibility and can cancel transactions within the 30-day window.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Available as a desktop and mobile app</li>
      <li>Drastically reduces risk of fast-draining malware</li>
      <li>No third-party custody: users still own their private keys</li>
      <li>Tamper-resistant validation via dual sources and cryptographic signatures</li>
      <li>User-friendly recovery buffer: aligns with real-world financial risk controls</li>
    </ul>
  </section>



  <section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Slowlyy is built on a simple principle: slowing down crypto can actually make it safer. With a minimal but powerful dual-verification time lock, users gain crucial time to act in emergencies. This wallet architecture redefines digital self-custody security by prioritizing control and recovery over speed.
